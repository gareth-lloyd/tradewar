- set slider to correct position based on tariff
- interest groups are happy based on whether the prices they face or greater or
 lower than expectations.
- model interest group: citizens
   - They want to buy a fixed basket of goods (try and get realistic
     quantities and prices)
   - based on the variation of the price of this basket, they are happy or
     unhappy
   - in this model then, consumption is fixed, happiness varies
   - nb. keep the quantities/expected prices broken out by good, so that
     citizens can state the cause of their unhappiness
- model interest group: business
   - country's consumption is supplied domestically/from abroad
   - Assume total consumption remains the same. Could be two effects:
       - price differential between foreign/domestic suppliers
       - change in proportion of domestic/foreign consumption caused by price
         differential

TODO:
- Allow interst groups to feed back their preferences
- Implement finish turn and change state
    - Apply rules
    - Display the results
    - Set up for subsequent turn
- read up on routing to decide whether that's the way to go
- Cost changes should be roughly related to the Data supplied
- break out business interests into importers and exporters
- model trade partners as interest groups
- A graph of tariff changes over time


Ideas
- Consumers/producers should start off happy/sad based on country properties
- Can choose different starting countries with different qualities - free trade
  or restricted trade
- Business interests can probabilistically ask for subsidies and get pissed off
  if they're turned down.
- Citizens can probabilistically complain about prices and similarly get pissed
  off
- Oil price shocks must be responded to correctly
    - boosts price - bring down tariffs to keep people happy?
- Model productivity levels
- model Hostility levels
- Government gets income from tariffs

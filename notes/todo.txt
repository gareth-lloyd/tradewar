- set slider to correct position based on tariff
- interest groups are happy based on whether the prices they face or greater or
 lower than expectations.
- model interest group: citizens
   - They want to buy a fixed basket of goods (try and get realistic
     quantities and prices)
   - based on the variation of the price of this basket, they are happy or
     unhappy
   - in this model then, consumption is fixed, happiness varies
   - nb. keep the quantities/expected prices broken out by good, so that
     citizens can state the cause of their unhappiness
- model interest group: business
   - country's consumption is supplied domestically/from abroad
   - Assume total consumption remains the same. Could be two effects:
       - price differential between foreign/domestic suppliers
       - change in proportion of domestic/foreign consumption caused by price
         differential
- Implement finish turn and change state
    - Apply rules
    - Display the results
    - Set up for subsequent turn
- read up on routing to decide whether that's the way to go
- Consumers/producers should start off happy/sad based on country properties
- record the year, test year changes at turn transition
    - signals?
- include prices next to tariff rates, and show the impact on tariff changes
- make it record historic prices at every change of turn


TODO:
- detect changedGoods
- Add in information about actual demands and the amount people are 
  paying in excess of what they should in fact be paying
- beautify interst groups feedback
- Cost changes should be roughly related to the Data supplied
- Model the opposing country
- break out business interests into importers and exporters
- model trade partners as interest groups
- A graph of tariff changes over time
- Business interests can probabilistically ask for subsidies and get pissed off
  if they're turned down.
- Citizens can probabilistically complain about prices and similarly get pissed
  off
- Oil price shocks (increase or decrease) can happen
    - a 'news' object which can modify game variables and report an event
    - boosts price - bring down tariffs to keep people happy?


IDEAS
- make price expectations depend on the last x years of price history
- Government income from tariffs, spending on trade easing?
- Can choose different starting countries with different qualities - free trade
  or restricted trade
- Model productivity levels
- model Hostility levels
- display other data for the year in question, and

- set slider to correct position based on tariff
- interest groups are happy based on whether the prices they face or greater or
 lower than expectations.
- model interest group: citizens
   - They want to buy a fixed basket of goods (try and get realistic
     quantities and prices)
   - based on the variation of the price of this basket, they are happy or
     unhappy
   - in this model then, consumption is fixed, happiness varies
   - nb. keep the quantities/expected prices broken out by good, so that
     citizens can state the cause of their unhappiness
- model interest group: business
   - country's consumption is supplied domestically/from abroad
   - Assume total consumption remains the same. Could be two effects:
       - price differential between foreign/domestic suppliers
       - change in proportion of domestic/foreign consumption caused by price
         differential
- Implement finish turn and change state
    - Apply rules
    - Display the results
    - Set up for subsequent turn
- read up on routing to decide whether that's the way to go
- Consumers/producers should start off happy/sad based on country properties
- record the year, test year changes at turn transition
    - signals?
- include prices next to tariff rates, and show the impact on tariff changes
- make it record historic prices at every change of turn
- detect changedGoods
- improve look of interst groups feedback
    - complain about actual price change/foreign competition
    - colour
- set base prices so that actual prices are obtained off the bat
- Model opposing country
    - starts with retaliatory tariffs of some proportion of domestic tariffs
      (probabilistic, realistic?)
    - opposing country tariffs appear on the adjust screen
    - opposing country can change tariffs (probabilistically) if there's enough
      difference.
- move detectChanged to a changedGoods method on Histric
- move histories to their relveant objects and sign them up to events
- exporter's interests depend on the opposing country (india's main trade
  partner - China)
- move relevant goods to GameModel
- sort out the moods
- images for interest groups
- Icons instead of background colours for moods
- sort out the average feedback
- The feedback should be grouped, wiht individual interet groups stating
  their case, rather than separate.
- improve partner response feedback: exporters should complain
- change price adjustment
    - two prices on the page: current price, and if you change the tariff, the
      predicted price appears.
    - actual price changes should be probabilistic

TODO:
- start the game with a message from Main trading partner
- btn classes
- come up with an overall score based on historic moods
    - play through different ways and decide what a good score for a particular
      country is. 
    - award points for exceeding that.
- messages from partners based on whether or not they exceed your tariff
  movement.
- graph of tariff changes over time
- Oil price shocks (increase or decrease) (which add a fixed component to can happen
    - a 'news' object which can modify game variables and report an event
    - boosts price - bring down tariffs to keep people happy?
- Government income from tariffs, spending on trade easing?

IDEAS
- make price expectations depend on the last x years of price history
- Can choose different starting countries with different qualities - free trade
  or restricted trade
- Model productivity levels
- display other data for the year in question, and

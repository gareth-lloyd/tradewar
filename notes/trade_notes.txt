Foundations:
Comparative Advantage
- The country is said to have a comparative advantage over another country if it
  loses less alternative production opportunities in producing certain good. 
    - Russia has a small absolute advantage over Finland in labor-intensive
      products such as clothes, and a huge one in land-intensive products such as
      wood because of its land and labor resources. Even so Finland has a
      comparative advantage in  labor-intensive clothes because producing clothes
      is cheaper in terms of lost wood.

Dynamics of trade wars
- subsidies may be difficult to retaliate against by a foreign country.
- poor countries are more vulnerable than rich countries in trade wars; in
  raising protections against dumping of cheap products, a government risks
  making the product too expensive for its people to afford.

- A basic model says that trade restrictions can bring short-term gains, but
  that these gains are wiped out by losses due to retaliation, leaving both
  countries worse off.
- Johnson (1953-1954) proved this conclusion wrong: a country can win a tariff
  war despite retaliation, if its elasticity of demand for imports  is
  significantly higher than opponentâ€™s.

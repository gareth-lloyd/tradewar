Foundations:
Comparative Advantage
- The country is said to have a comparative advantage over another country if it
  loses less alternative production opportunities in producing certain good. 
    - Russia has a small absolute advantage over Finland in labor-intensive
      products such as clothes, and a huge one in land-intensive products such as
      wood because of its land and labor resources. Even so Finland has a
      comparative advantage in  labor-intensive clothes because producing clothes
      is cheaper in terms of lost wood.

Dynamics of trade wars
- subsidies may be difficult to retaliate against by a foreign country.
- poor countries are more vulnerable than rich countries in trade wars; in
  raising protections against dumping of cheap products, a government risks
  making the product too expensive for its people to afford.

- A basic model says that trade restrictions can bring short-term gains, but
  that these gains are wiped out by losses due to retaliation, leaving both
  countries worse off.
- Johnson (1953-1954) proved this conclusion wrong: a country can win a tariff
  war despite retaliation, if its elasticity of demand for imports  is
  significantly higher than opponentâ€™s.

Game Form
- Turn by turn over a period of 'years'
- inputs -> take turn -> receive feedback ad nauseum

STATE
- independent:
    - tariff levels (player inputs)
    - oil prices
- dependent
    - price levels
    - output?
    - productivity?
    - hostility levels

Interface
- Sliders to input tariff values
- feedback in price levels
- Feedback from:
    - Citizens
    - Business poeple
    - Trade partners
- A graph of tariff changes over time

- Cost changes should be roughly related to the Data supplied

First version
- play as India
- One good: shoes
    - one price
    - one tarriff
- One interest group: citizens
- no 'opponent'

Ideas to make it varied:
- Business interests can probabilistically ask for subsidies and get pissed off
  if they're turned down.
- Citizens can probabilistically complain about prices and similarly get pissed
  off
- Oil price shocks must be responded to
